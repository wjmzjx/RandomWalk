ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:



----------------------------------------------
ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):

Question 1: The path has many dead ends because at every step the drunkard has 1/4 chances to continue at the same path. The probability of him moving in a straight line with no dead ends is very small for a large number of steps. 

Question 2 &3. 

My program does not display any special behaviour when I minimize the JFrame. This is because I placed the 2D points in an array in the main program and then transferred them in the paintcomponent where they were manipulated to be drawn. If the loop of the steps was done in the RandomWalkComponent instead, the window would be redrawn with a new random path each time the window was minimized and maximized.
